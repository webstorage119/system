The point of the system extensions is to provide

1. A set of basic classes (enum, struct, unicode string) for other items to use
2. Processes (creation, enumeration, control)
3. Threading (FOR TS PHP versions ONLY)
4. Sychronization (Mutex, Event, Timer, Semaphore, Wait) - possibly more features
5. Registry
6. Basic Windows information

Additional features such as
1. Windows services
2. pipes, mailslots and other ipc
3. device services, etc

Will end up in other extensions
